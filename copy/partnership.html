<h2>Client Referral Agencies</h2>

<p>Suits his Style works closely with various organizations across Ottawa offering employment programming for men looking to enter or re-enter the workforce. Clients of these organizations are then referred to Suits his Style once they are 'job-ready', as assessed by our referral partners, to access our services.</p>

<p>Our services have been extended to men facing economic hardships due to unexpected or chronic unemployment. These individuals face difficulties due to their unique circumstances and are at further disadvantage during the interview process without appropriate attire; thus impacting their confidence and, ultimately, their ability to succeed at a job interview.</p>

<p>Since beginning operations in August 2014, we have suited 54 clients, 26 of whom have since found employment, and 10 of whom have become self-employed or have elected to further their education. There is great need for our type of organization in the community as we provide a unique service. Our community partners have already come to rely on our services, and we have received consistently positive feedback from both clients and referral partners.</p>
