<p>Suits his Style is a non-profit that promotes the employment opportunities of men in need by providing professional attire. As a volunteer-run organization, we depend on dedicated volunteers who are passionate about our vision.</p>

<h2>Why volunteer?</h2>

<p>Volunteers are the backbone of Suits his Style. The impact of your time is immediately clear when volunteering with Suits his Style; men who are chronically unemployed visibly have more self-confidence by the end of their appointment. You also can gain experience in social work while helping men back on their feet, to support themselves and their families.</p>

<p>It’s important that you feel valued and respected. We provide regular networking opportunities to meet fellow volunteers, and the founders/Board of Directors are always happy to meet with you to discuss any suggestions, ideas, or questions that you may have. Grow professionally and personally while contributing to our community!</p>

<h2>What kind of work will I be doing?</h2>

<h3>Frontline volunteers (working directly with clients)</h3>

<p>Frontline volunteers provide our clients with a style consultation, outfitting men with suits, shirts, ties and other donated accessories. This service boosts the confidence and self-esteem of the client, and increases their chances of finding employment.</p>

<h3>Backstage volunteers (clothing sorters, committee members)</h3>
