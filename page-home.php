        Suits his Style helps reduce poverty in our community by providing interview clothing and/or industry appropriate clothing to low income, unemployed men in need of employment.

      <p>
        By providing job-ready men with appropriate interview attire, Suits his Style helps a man find employment;
        enabling him to support himself, his family, and contribute more fully to Canadian society.
